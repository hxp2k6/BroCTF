Barcodez accepts a connection and prompts the user for the filename of the
image uploaded prior through the php script. It then uses popen to run the
image through dmtxread and read the outputed data into memory. This can be
exploited since it reads extra data past the size of the buffer it's going
into. Originally I had attempted this with QR codes but found they are a
giant pile of crap and a pain in the ass. I couldn't find an implementation
that properly supported the 8-bit byte encoding and thus had to use ascii
shellcode. I didn't have time to write a proper exploit that utilized ROP
techniques to jump to the shellcode so it was switched to data matrices. For
extra leet hacker points, switch to zxing/zbar for QR code decoding and write
an exploit that works.

payload.bin is the shellcode from msfplayload
nop1.bin is 354 bytes of 0x90
nop2.bin is 354 bytes of 0x90
addr.bin is addr to overwite with

To build a proper exploit image:

$ cat nop1.bin payload.bin nop2.bin addr.bin | dmtxwrite -e 8 -o evil.png
