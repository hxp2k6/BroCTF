This challenge is an exercise in knowing how to not properly redact a file. ;) 

We made the challenge by grabbing the images of the LULZsec leader from scribd and then importing them as image frames into scribus.

From here, we added the key as a text box over some of the text.  We also modified some of the text with other text boxes.  Lastly, we drew some black boxes over parts of the text to "redact" some of what was in there.

At this point, scribus allowed us to export to PDF.

It's actually a super easy challenge.  pdfgrep will show you the solution if you know what strings to grep for. Additionally, Okular, xpdf, etc. will allow you to select the text around the black box, and then copy it to the clip board unredacted.
