Super straight forward stack overflow with stack cookies which are generated
using the random() function seeded with the current time on the minute mark.
However the box has egress filtering that only permits udp traffic on port 53
to exit the box and the socket is closed before the function returns requiring
the attacker to use a reverse bind shell

Hard way to solve this:
Write super awsome udp reverse bind shell that runs over port 53. If someone
actually does this awesome leet haxor bonus points for you as long as I can get
a copy because that truly is badass.

Easier way to solve this:
ncat is installed on the box and supports udp traffic. A clever hacker could
write some simple exec()/system() shellcode that simply cats the flag file
into netcat over udp to a listening daemon on a box they control. Also mad
props for anyone who figures this out because you sir are a resourceful mother
fucker who's not gonna let a little thing like egress filtering force you to
crank out some truly awesome but horribly complex shellcode.

Hope anyone who competes enjoys this challenge because it was definitely one of
my favorites to design this year. Thanks to k9X from #social for all the help
in coming up with the idea.
