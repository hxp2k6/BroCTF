This challenge was created by opening Wireshark, and selecting a USB interface to capture on.  I then plugged in a thumb drive, copied the key over to it, and then unmounted and disconnected the drive, the stopped the capture.

There's no easy "follow streams" option here.  But if you look carefully at the length column, you'll see some areas that stand out.
