  Bro, I'm so in. This is going to be fucking epic! I was looking at the site and
  saw that pre-registration had already been announced. Let's sign up and make
  sure that we get a spot so we can school these scrubs. Here's the link, go
  ahead and get us all setup and I'll grab a room at the Rio. We should definitely
  roll in early so we can go hit the clubs first and slam some jagerbombs!

  Subject: Epic Brodown!

  Sup Broseph!?
  I was playing this sick game of ultimate today with one of the other startups
  at our co-working space. They were burning super hard after we kicked their ass
  and started talking mad shit. One of the dudes starts talking shit about my
  brogramming chops and I was all like, "Come at me, bro!" Then he was all like,
  "Naw Kimbro Slice, we gotta handle this right. We're having a brodown!" They
  told me about this contest out in Vegas called BroCTF. At first I thought it
  was some kind of sweet mashup of dirt biking and capture the flag but
  apparently it's this totally chill competition for hackers and brogrammers.

  The contest is supposed to be at this epic hacker meetup called DEFCON which
  is having it's 20th Anniversary this year. I was thinking we grab some more
  bros, road trip out to vegas, and show these scrubs how to rage like real
  brogrammers. I hear they're gonna be bumping some hardcore brostep all weekend
  and have some totally sweet challenges this year. The game is suppossed to run
  Fri and Sat 10:00-10:00 and most of the day on Sunday. Should give us plenty
  of time to show these fauxbros what's up and still slam some jager bombs at the
  clubs!
